     <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Even with the advances in science and technology, many people lagged behind and 
        were not able to cope with the pace of the growth in many places around the world. Most were unaware
         of the benefits of online education or of the existence of online classes in various countries. Just 
         like every coin has two sides, there are two sides to online classes as well. Online classes are 
         beneficial to continue our education with various barriers. But online activities have the chance 
         to digress into other addictive online activities at times when it comes to kids. Excess of anything 
         is dangerous; therefore, investing too much time can harm the kids. Thus, the parents should be 
         responsible enough to take care of their children during the online classes.</p>

             are now helping students as well as teachers with different study materials, various online courses,
              etc., at a very reasonable cost so that education can be accessible and available to all grades of

              classes because they get their own space for learning. They can learn in their own comfort zone.
